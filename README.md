Congress
========

Congress is a search engine passthrough service, with customizable shortcut
patterns.  This means you can replace your preferred search engine, such as
Google or [DuckDuckGo][], with Congress, and use special patterns to instead
search elsewhere, or have shortcuts that take you to predictable URL paths.

For example, searching for the phrase "w psychology" could take you directly
to the search results on Wikipedia for "psychology"; searching "y rick astley"
could take you to YouTube results; and any search that doesn't trigger these
custom patterns could fall back to your search engine of preference.
